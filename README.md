# Wireless-AC-VOLTAGE-DETACTOR-Project
Electricity can cause serious injury or even death which is why safety must come first when working with electricity devices. In industries accident takes place due to leakage of electricity. The accidents can be avoided by using the wireless AC voltage detector. The motive of this project is to detect presence of electricity wirelessly. The detection takes place continuously which can be monitored by the glowing LED or by buzzer or both at the same time. Three main components are used in this project which are, All the above components are systematically placed on the breadboard that the voltage sensor sense the voltage and make our circuit to flow current in such a way that it glows our LED or beep our buzzer, which let us know the presence of the voltage. This concept can be used to detect any breakage in the voltage line, when we will move our sensor on the covered voltage line, it will glow the LED or turn on the buzzer till the point where there is breakage in the line and after that break point in the line it stops glowing LED.
